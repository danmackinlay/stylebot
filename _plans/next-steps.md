# Next steps — what to ship

**Purpose.** The forward-looking operational overlay: what's built and the next
moves in priority order, with concrete commands. The authoritative spec is
[`OVERVIEW.md`](OVERVIEW.md) + the per-phase files + `../CLAUDE.md`; this is the
"you are here, go there next" layer. The mechanism/policy codebase is clean (the
QA declutter landed 2026-06-29) — focus here on functionality, not housekeeping.

## Current state (built + verified)

All green: `uv run pytest -q` = **101 passing** (stylebot); the blog runner
`uv run python tests/test_training_targets.py` = **13/13**; `ruff` clean. The QA
declutter (2026-06-29) removed dead blog-build code + the direct-Anthropic
generator/dep (hosted models go via OpenRouter); ~430 lines gone, both repos.

- **Phase 0/1** — scaffolding + `ai-style-log` (daily pair capture) shipped;
  heading context added.
- **Phase 2** — `ai-style synth` / blog `train-targets` built + curated. Slop is
  a **knob** (`STRATEGIES` / `--slop-strategy` / `--slop-system-file`) and
  **multi-source** via `openrouter_generator` (one `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). The
  paid at-scale run is **not yet done** — it's the active step below.
- **Eval** — `stylebot.eval` + `ai-style eval` (batched, JSONL-native): scores a
  `pairs.jsonl` → id-keyed `scores.jsonl`, `summarize_scores(by=…)`, and a scores
  **HTML report** (`--report`). Live OpenRouter judge wiring is **verified**.
- **Deferred (planned, not built):** the statistical-detector audition (eval's
  4th signal), `meta.weight`, Phase 3 (LoRA training), Phase 4 (inference CLI).

## Next move — the two unblocked tracks (run in parallel)

### A. The Phase-2 experimental generation loop (the active step)

Not a one-shot paid run — an iterate-and-promote loop. Per slop strategy:
generate a small batch into a **scratch** dir, eyeball, score, and promote a
winner into the real corpus. Generating with real models and judging both need
the key, so run via `direnv exec` (see Environment).

```sh
cd ~/Source/stylebot
# 1. generate a small batch for one strategy into a throwaway dir:
direnv exec . uv run ai-style synth --blog-root ~/Source/livingthing \
  --data-dir /tmp/slop-experiments --slop-strategy catalogue \
  --openrouter-model anthropic/claude-opus-4-8 --openrouter-model openai/gpt-4o \
  --limit 40 --report /tmp/exp-targets.html
# 2. score it + compare flavours + eyeball the pairs:
direnv exec . uv run ai-style eval --pairs /tmp/slop-experiments/pairs.jsonl \
  --judge --by slop_strategy --report /tmp/exp-scores.html
# 3. repeat for other strategies into the SAME scratch dir (synth_key carries the
#    strategy, so they accumulate without colliding), compare the per-strategy Δ.
```

**Promote the winner** into the real corpus (the blog path is the production run):

```sh
cd ~/Source/livingthing
direnv exec . uv run train-targets --dry-run --report /tmp/corpus.html   # vet first
direnv exec . uv run train-targets --limit 3000 --slop-strategy <winner>  # spends $$
```

Corpus lives at `~/Source/livingthing/_training_pairs/pairs.jsonl` (private,
gitignored). Gate it: `stylebot.pairs.validate_pairs_file(path)` must return `[]`.

**Watch for (the judge-calibration caveat):** in this real regime the "slop" is a
paraphrase of Dan's *own* prose, so slop and Dan scores sit closer than the easy
1-vs-4 split seen on contrived fixtures. The slop→Dan **delta** is the signal for
ranking strategies. If the judge bunches everything near 3, sharpen `JUDGE_SYSTEM`
(`stylebot.eval`) or move to a **pairwise** "which is more Dan-shaped" comparison.

### B. The detector audition (eval's one remaining signal)

The 4th eval signal. Plan + cost discipline are fully written in
[`eval-harness.md`](eval-harness.md) ("The detector decision", "Pangram —
captured, NOT implemented"). Shape:
- Audition free open-weights detectors (Binoculars / Ghostbuster / RADAR) vs
  **Pangram** on a ~30-paragraph test corpus, in the single-paragraph
  lightly-humanised regime. Pangram for the audition reference is ~$0.20.
- The seam is ready: drop the winner in as the default for
  `score_candidate(detector=…)` (a `prose -> {score, name}` callable). Default
  stays `null_detector` until decided. **Never** wire a paid detector as the live
  per-candidate default (see the cost discipline).
- GPU/$$ + operator's call — don't start without Dan's go-ahead.

## The data-gated tail (after enough corpus exists)

- **Phase 3 — LoRA training** ([`phase-3-training.md`](phase-3-training.md)):
  `stylebot.train.run_training` over `pairs.jsonl` (required `--data-dir`).
  Needs corpus volume. This is where `meta.weight` / synthetic down-weighting and
  the train/val split get decided — the id-keyed `scores.jsonl` is the input that
  makes per-pair weighting/filtering possible (an open question, see below).
- **Phase 4 — inference CLI** ([`phase-4-inference-cli.md`](phase-4-inference-cli.md)):
  `ai-style run <file>`. Needs a trained adapter. The eval scores report is
  **already generic over fields** — a styler run scored on `slop`/`output`/`target`
  renders the movement-toward-Dan view by adding one `FIELD_EXTRACTORS` entry.

## Open decisions / things to watch (from OVERVIEW "Open questions")

- **`meta.weight`** — down-weight synthetic vs real pairs at train time? What
  weight? The scores join makes it derivable; decide in Phase 3.
- **Single- vs multi-source slop ablation** — worth publishing? (`STRATEGIES` +
  `meta.generator`/`meta.slop_strategy` make this measurable now.)
- **Base model** — Qwen3 8B first, 70B if headroom allows.
- **Detector** — settled by the audition (track B).
- **Heading-context depth** — only `immediate` shipped; `breadcrumb` is designed
  but unbuilt (see `heading-context.md`).

## Environment & resume

- **Both repos checked out side by side** (`~/Source/stylebot`, `~/Source/livingthing`);
  the blog has an editable path dep on `../stylebot`.
- **Keys** in each repo's gitignored `.env` (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; optionally
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`LOCAL_LLM_*`; `PANGRAM_API_KEY` only if the
  audition picks it). **The key is only in env via `direnv exec uv run …`** — a
  bare `uv run` won't see it. Eval/synth run **keyless** by default (no judge / no
  paid generator), so tests and dry-runs need nothing.
- **Verify:** `cd ~/Source/stylebot && uv run pytest -q && uv run ruff check .`;
  `cd ~/Source/livingthing && uv run python tests/test_training_targets.py`.
- **Inspect with no spend:** `ai-style synth … --dry-run --report`, and
  `ai-style eval --pairs … --report` (keyless re-render over an existing
  `scores.jsonl` is a no-op pass).

## Guardrails (do not violate)

- **Never commit** the corpus (`_training_pairs/`, `pairs.jsonl`) or `.env`/`.envrc`.
  Sanity-check `git status` before every commit. stylebot is public.
- **`STYLE_SYSTEM` (`stylebot.ai_core`) is frozen** — changing it invalidates the
  whole corpus.
- **stylebot never imports `livingthing`** — mechanism stays generic; blog-specific
  policy lives only in `livingthing.training_targets` / `train_targets`.
- **PRs earn their place with a check** (a passing test or an eval number), per
  OVERVIEW "How we work". Plan edits commit straight to the branch.
